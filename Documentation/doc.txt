Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

1. Sample img dict
          "StreamLit\img"


2. Selenium code for web scraping and MySQL database interaction are in the folder

          Install packages
            ! pip install selenium
            ! pip install pandas
          
          - Created the empty list to store the collected data during the scraping
          - Select the states to scrap the data
          - Use page navigation for next page
          - Loop the states to scrap the data and store it as key values pair in list in bus_routes = []
          - Next loop through the bus_routes and get link ,routes name, state name
          - Loop the link to collect each routes data
          - Collect the data in each bus_routes through the link and store the data in bus_details = []
          - Use pandas to convert the collected data to dataframe to connect to DB


3. MySQL connection

          - Install package
              ! pip instal mysql-connector

          - Create the DB connection and
          - CREATE TABLE to add data in DB
